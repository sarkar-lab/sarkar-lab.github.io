Hi I am Hirak, a Ludwig Princeton Scholar at the [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu). I work in the field of cancer-genomics under the guidance of Prof. [Ben Raphael](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/braphael), and Prof. [Yibin Kang](https://molbio.princeton.edu/people/yibin-kang). I also collaborate with Prof. [Eileen White](https://www.cinj.org/research/eileen-white-phd)'s lab at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu) with Prof. [Peter Kharchenko](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-kharchenko) (till mid-2022) until his departure to [Altos](https://www.altoslabs.com/team/peter-kharchenko). I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](www.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of Prof. [Rob Patro](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/nomad).

The following are broadly my current research interests. See also my [list of
publications](/publications).

- Computational Biology
- Spatial Transcriptomics
- Machine Learning
- Algorithms
