Hi I am an Assistant Professor at the newly created [College of Connected Computing](https://computing.vanderbilt.edu/) and a faculty member of [Center for Computational Systems Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/computational-biology/) at the Vanderbilt University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park where I worked with Prof. [Robert Patro](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/nomad). Prior to joining Vanderbilt University, I was a Ludwig Princeton Scholar at the [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu) with  Prof. [Ben Raphael](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/braphael), and Prof. [Yibin Kang](https://molbio.princeton.edu/people/yibin-kang). I am passionate about answering biological question by employing techniques from statistics and machine learning. This line of research involves developing [novel methods]({% post_url 2024-03-02-method-dev %})
